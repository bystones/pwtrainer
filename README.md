Small utility to help learn a new password. Upon running the utility you will
be asked to enter the "correct" password. Afterwards you have to re-enter the
password from memory in an infinite loop. 

While the password is not shown when entering a small part of the difference to
the initial password entered will be shown every time the password is entering
incorrectly.
